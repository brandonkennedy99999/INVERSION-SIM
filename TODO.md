# TODO: Complete Visualization Integration in INVERSION-SIM

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Complete TopologyRenderer class in src/main.ts with methods to render grid, trajectory, and anomalies (e.g., drawGrid, drawTrajectory, renderAnomalies).
- [ ] Integrate TopologyRenderer in main.ts to display simulation results visually after running the simulation.
- [ ] Test the visualization by running `npx tsx src/main.ts` and verify output.
- [ ] Debug any issues with simulation behavior or rendering (e.g., if inversion/anomalies not working as expected).
- [ ] Commit changes with a proper message (e.g., "Complete TopologyRenderer and integrate visualization in main.ts").
